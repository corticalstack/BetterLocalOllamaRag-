I will plan to do a step by video series of how to set this up and run it over on Youtube
https://www.youtube.com/@AI_by_AI_007/videos In the meantime here are the steps:

### Initial Setup (You should complete these defore starting on the software):
* Do you have an Nvidia GPU?  Make sure your Nvidia Drivers are set up
   * https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us
* Install Docker
   * https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/
* Install Ollama
   * https://www.ollama.com
   * Setup Video: (https://youtu.be/90ozfdsQOKo)

### Software Setup 
* Launch the Docker contiainer for Ollama Models:  docker-compose up  
* Before installing these packages download and install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Choose you project folder where you will run this software
* Clone or copy the files from this repo here with our "BetterLocalOllamaRag" software build
* Open a terminal in that folder (Setup Videdo:  https://youtu.be/P3aKRdUyr0s)
* run this: npm install express
* run this: npm install langchain
* run this: npm install openai (ollama is openai API Compatible)

* Optional Sign up for the free Tier D-ID Avatar service - (www.d-id.com add your d-id api key) edit the `api.json` and replace text with your key
* Run a test to ensure your D-ID api is set correctly by checking d-id credit balance:  Run node test_d_id.js

* Run a test to ensure yor api is set correctly by checking Ollama:  Run a local Query to your LLM using or preferred tool Webui etc
* Got issues with Ollama?  Check this channel -- hands down best Ollama resource:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90ozfdsQOKo
* Ask for assistance over on D-ID discord https://discord.gg/Ux6S5mQT as I am on there daily

## Start the demo:
* From directory where you installed Node (npm install express)
* start up the server with node app.js
* You should see this message - server started on port localhost:3001
* (open index.html app) in the browser add http://localhost:3001/index.html
* (connect) press connect you should see the connection ready 
* The looping Avatar video should play
* Clear all the check boxes and test that you can chat with your Ollama Model only (No Did Avatar)
* Once Ollama and you LLM are chatting then test voice typing to see if your browser is set up correctly
* Check the box to send to D-ID and press the connect button to set up streaming conmnections
* Input a Chat and the D-ID service will animate the response 

## Final Thoughts
* Be patient and enjoy the puzzle if things are not working right away -- stay with it you will get it!
